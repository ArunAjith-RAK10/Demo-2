# Demo-for-GitHub

This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & GitHub.

Things I did for making this repository.

 + Created a empty repository named `Demo-for-GitHub` in [GitHub](https://gitHub.com/new).
 + Copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are 
    ```
     echo "# Demo-for-GitHub" >> README.md
     git init
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "README.md"
     git branch -M main
     git remote add origin https://github.com/ArunAjith-RAK10/Demo-for-GitHub.git
     git push -u origin main
    ```
 + I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. Then I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
   + The first line of copied contents `echo "Demo-for-GitHub" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the content `"Demo-for-GitHub"`.
