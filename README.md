# Demo-2

This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & GitHub.

Things I did for making this repository.

 + Created a empty repository named `Animated-doodle-RAK` in [GitHub](https://gitHub.com/new)
 + Copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are 
    ```
     echo "# Demo-2" >> README.md
     git init
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "README.md"
     git branch -M main
     git remote add origin https://github.com/ArunAjith-RAK10/Demo-2.git
     git push -u origin main
    ```
